          After completing my masterâ€™s education and ML startup experience, I decided to <strong>join medical school</strong> in order to
          develop <strong>medical domain expertise</strong> and ideate how digital health solutions can innovate future clinical practice.

          Since joining Mount Sinai, I have <strong>interviewed 100+ clinicians, surgeons, patients, and healthcare workers</strong> to better
          understand the interaction between the healthcare ecosystem and key stakeholders. I have also received funding to create my own AI-driven digital health solution at Sinai BioDesign.

      >
          Outside of the classroom, I dedicate time towards <strong>education and mentorship</strong>.
          I advise prospective medical students, mentor students interested in data science, and organize an annual <strong>AI in Medicine lecture series</strong> highlighting industry leaders working at the forefront of AI.
